# Task 3.6 — Demo Collateral & Playbook

- Milestone: [MILESTONE-6_DEMO_POLISH](../milestones/MILESTONE-6_DEMO_POLISH.md)

## Objective
Create the assets, scripts, and contingency plans needed for a smooth judge-facing demo showcasing the prompt-to-deploy loop.

## Deliverables
- Demo script outlining narration, command sequence, and timing (≤7 minutes).
- Backup workspace with prebuilt artifacts and cached dependencies for offline fallback.
- Failure playbook covering common issues (RPC downtime, spend cap, install hangs) with recovery steps.
- Screenshots or terminal recordings for inclusion in submission materials.

## Key Steps
1. Draft narrated run-through including onboarding, `/new`, `/deploy`, `/review`.
2. Prepare backup project folder with zipped artifacts and instructions for switching quickly.
3. Document failure scenarios and resolution steps; rehearse with team to validate.
4. Capture high-quality screenshots/GIFs of key CLI moments.
5. Store all materials in `docs/roadmap/done/` or `docs/roadmap/milestones/` referencing the milestone.

## Dependencies
- Completion of core features from Milestones 1 and 2.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Team members can deliver demo end-to-end following the script without external guidance.
- Backup assets verified to work on target demo machine.
- Failure playbook reviewed and acknowledged by team; assets linked in milestone notes.

## Owners
- Tech Lead coordinates; QA/DevOps maintains backup assets; CLI engineer assists with recordings.
