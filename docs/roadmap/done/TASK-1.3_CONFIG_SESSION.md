# Task 1.3 â€” Config & Session Services

- Milestone: [MILESTONE-1_FOUNDATIONS](../milestones/MILESTONE-1_FOUNDATIONS.md)

## Objective
Provide persistent configuration and in-memory session state so the agent tracks active project metadata and stores defaults in `~/.solcoder/config.toml`.

## Deliverables
- `src/solcoder/core/config.py` with pydantic models, default values, and read/write helpers.
- Creation of `~/.solcoder/config.toml` on first launch with network, spend cap, template defaults, and LLM provider settings (endpoint, model, safety flags).
- Session manager object capturing wallet status, current project dir, and spend meter counters.
- Unit tests covering load/save, migration of missing keys, and session state resets.

## Key Steps
1. Model configuration schema (network, rpc_url, auto_airdrop, max_session_spend, telemetry).
2. Implement functions to load existing config, merge defaults, and persist user edits.
3. Prompt user on first run for LLM base URL + API key, store credentials securely (encrypted file or OS keyring) and persist provider defaults.
4. Add session class storing runtime fields (current template, active command, log handles).
5. Expose `/config get/set` stubs that interact with the config service, including `llm.provider`, `llm.base_url`, `llm.model`, and command to rotate API token.
6. Write tests in `tests/core/test_config.py` and `tests/core/test_session.py` covering secret storage and retrieval.

## Dependencies
- Task 1.1 for project tooling.
- Task 1.2 for CLI shell integration points.

## Acceptance Criteria
- First run generates config file with sanitized defaults, correct permissions, and persists encrypted LLM credentials.
- Updating config values (including LLM provider/model) reflects in session state without restarting the app; rotating the API key updates secure storage.
- Tests cover both positive and failure paths; coverage reports include new modules.

## Owners
- CLI engineer, with QA support for path/permission validation on macOS and Ubuntu.
