# Task 2.6 — Live Status Bar & Logs

- Milestone: [MILESTONE-2_CONVERSATIONAL_CORE](../milestones/MILESTONE-2_CONVERSATIONAL_CORE.md)
- Status: Completed — shipped with Rich status bar integration and `/logs` command
- Completion Date: 2025-10-17

## Summary
Implemented a prompt-toolkit-friendly status bar that streams wallet, network, spend, and active project information inline with the REPL. Added a centralized `LogBuffer` publishing build/deploy/wallet activity, surfaced through the `/logs` command.

The feature was validated through manual CLI review during long-running operations plus unit coverage for the log store, ensuring the UI remains responsive and secrets stay redacted.

## Deliverables
- Rich-based status bar with reactive updates tied to session metadata.
- In-memory log buffer and `/logs` command with severity filtering.
- Tests covering log storage behaviour and snapshot checks for the status bar renderer.

## Notes
- UX review signed off in Milestone 2 kickoff doc.
- Follow-up: consider adding configurable log retention and exporting to `.solcoder/logs/`.
