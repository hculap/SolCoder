## {{PROGRAM_NAME_TITLE}} â€” Registry Blueprint (Stub)

This is a stubbed Anchor workspace for a PDA registry program.

- Program name: `{{PROGRAM_NAME_SNAKE}}`
- Cluster: `{{CLUSTER}}`
- Program ID (placeholder): `{{PROGRAM_ID}}`

### Next Steps
- Build with Anchor:
  ```bash
  anchor build
  ```
- Deploy and update Anchor.toml `programs.{{CLUSTER}}` with the deployed program id.
- Interact using SolCoder:
  - `/deploy` once adapters are active
  - `/program inspect <PROGRAM_ID>` to view instructions
